            A fast random number generator for .NET
            Colin Green, January 2005
            
            September 4th 2005
              Added NextBytesUnsafe() - commented out by default.
             Fixed bug in Reinitialise() - y,z and w variables were not being reset.
            
            Key points:
             1) Based on a simple and fast xor-shift pseudo random number generator (RNG) specified in: 
             Marsaglia, George. (2003). Xorshift RNGs.
             http://www.jstatsoft.org/v08/i14/xorshift.pdf
             
             This particular implementation of xorshift has a period of 2^128-1. See the above paper to see
             how this can be easily extened if you need a longer period. At the time of writing I could find no 
             information on the period of System.Random for comparison.
            
             2) Faster than System.Random. Up to 8x faster, depending on which methods are called.
            
             3) Direct replacement for System.Random. This class implements all of the methods that System.Random 
             does plus some additional methods. The like named methods are functionally equivalent.
             
             4) Allows fast re-initialisation with a seed, unlike System.Random which accepts a seed at construction
             time which then executes a relatively expensive initialisation routine. This provides a vast speed improvement
             if you need to reset the pseudo-random number sequence many times, e.g. if you want to re-generate the same
             sequence many times. An alternative might be to cache random numbers in an array, but that approach is limited
             by memory capacity and the fact that you may also want a large number of different sequences cached. Each sequence
             can each be represented by a single seed value (int) when using FastRandom.
             
             Notes.
             A further performance improvement can be obtained by declaring local variables as static, thus avoiding 
             re-allocation of variables on each call. However care should be taken if multiple instances of
             FastRandom are in use or if being used in a multi-threaded environment.

        <member name="M:FastRandom.FastRandom.Next">
            <summary>
            Generates a random int over the range 0 to int.MaxValue-1.
            MaxValue is not generated in order to remain functionally equivalent to System.Random.Next().
            This does slightly eat into some of the performance gain over System.Random, but not much.
            For better performance see:
            
            Call NextInt() for an int over the range 0 to int.MaxValue.
            
            Call NextUInt() and cast the result to an int to generate an int over the full Int32 value range
            including negative values.

        <member name="M:FastRandom.FastRandom.NextBytes(System.Byte[])">
            <summary>
            Fills the provided byte array with random bytes.
            This method is functionally equivalent to System.Random.NextBytes().

        <member name="M:FastRandom.FastRandom.NextUInt">

            Generates a uint. Values returned are over the full range of a uint, 
            uint.MinValue to uint.MaxValue, inclusive.
            
            This is the fastest method for generating a single random number because the underlying
            random number generator algorithm generates 32 random bits that can be cast directly to 
            a uint.

            <summary>
            Generates a random int over the range 0 to int.MaxValue, inclusive. 
            This method differs from Next() only in that the range is 0 to int.MaxValue
            and not 0 to int.MaxValue-1.
            
            The slight difference in range means this method is slightly faster than Next()
            but is not functionally equivalent to System.Random.Next().

            Generates a single random bit.
            This method's performance is improved by generating 32 bits in one operation and storing them
            ready for future calls.
